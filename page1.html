        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">In April of 2014 Tristan was a competitive&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">gymnast. She would often spend 25 hours a week and more at the gym. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">After struggling with injuries and a coach that was particularly rough&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">on her, Jamie and I made the difficult decision to pull her out of the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">sport that she loved so much. Tristan became very depressed because it&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">was devastating to her. She worships my sister Eva so I began taking</span></p><p>her to Eva's house a lot. Before long, she started riding my nephews&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">horse, L.A.. We began to see some joy come back into her eyes, and by&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">May of that year we convinced my nephew to sell his horse to us. We&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">bought a horse trailer and started going to local game-shows. This is&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">the way my family and many others have gotten started, it's the place&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">to start before the big barrel racing shows which are the step before&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">your ultimate goal, which is rodeo. Tristan's first show in Lake Helen</span></p><p>was on her birthday, the 4th of July. She didn't win anything that&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">time, but on her second show in August, she won "Grand Champion". &nbsp;It&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">seemed like she was taking well to it and that she was a natural. Some&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">of that might be from her gymnastics, but I like to think it has&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">something to do with genetics. In September she tried her first big</span></p><p>barrel race. She didn't win any money that time, however, she did place&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">on points. At her next big show in December she won a division and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">qualified for the "National Barrel Horse Associations World Show". &nbsp;I&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">would like to say the rest is history because we have moved on from&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">there. &nbsp;She has won money at the "Florida State National" barrel horse&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">show in which there were about 1000 entries. &nbsp;She has qualified each&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">year for the NBHA open and youth world shows. &nbsp;This is a huge feat when&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">you consider only the top 5 in each division qualify. Her hopes are to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">participate in the Florida High School rodeo starting next fall,</span></p><p>following in mine, my sisters, and my nephews footsteps. &nbsp;After that, a&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">college rodeo career could be in her future. Whatever your future</span></p><p>holds, Tristan, you have made us PROUD!</p></div>
